# How this website is made

## A static website based on Pandoc Framework

I Know, in the last month I modified my web site several times but there is a reason: **I am not an easthete**, then, I tried to find a right balance between usability, beauty, manutenibility and portability.

The first goal was: **My web site, as security engineer, will be must unhackable** for this reason I opt to choose a static web site type. 

I tried to develop directly in **HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript** but it was so complicated and unmaintainable, I tried to use the **Jekyll** framework but it was so tricky, everytime I had to use docker and sometimes program in Ruby to resolve a lot bugs. 

The solution, imho, is **Pandoc** 🐼: [_Write in Markdown and generate the HTML and much more_](https://pandoc.org/).

I spent a lot of time to read, study and configure my environment to achieve the four goal that I quote before: **usability, beauty, manutenibility and portability**. 

After some Google searches I found this wonderful [_article_](https://thisdavej.com/build-an-amazing-markdown-editor-using-visual-studio-code-and-pandoc/) that opened my POV: **Build an Amazing Markdown Editor Using Visual Studio Code and Pandoc**. 

With this environment I can write simple Markdown code, apply a static template and generates the related HTML5 pages. To increse my productivity I develop two simple **Powershell** script(_now is multiplatform_) that builds the entire blog and creates new articles.

Special thanks to [Vito Nicola Galluzzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolagalluzzi/) and [Angela Caporale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelacaporale/), they convinced me to change my horrible old website.
